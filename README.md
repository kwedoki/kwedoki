## 👋 Hey, I’m Andy (Kwedo)
London-based product design leader with 25+ years in digital. I work best where **strategy meets craft** — turning fuzzy opportunities into clear product direction, aligning teams, and shipping experiences that feel *inevitable*.

### What I’m known for
- 🧭 Product vision + UX strategy that moves metrics *and* hearts  
- 🧪 Research, rapid validation, prototyping, iteration loops  
- 🧩 Design systems (tokens, governance, scalability across platforms)  
- 🤝 Working tight with engineering & stakeholders to ship the real thing  

---

## 🧠 Design mantra
**Listen carefully → understand deeply → answer with engaging, thoughtful experiences — with brand personality.**

---

## 🧰 Focus areas
- Product discovery & definition (problem framing, opportunity mapping)
- Product-Market Fit
- UX research (qual + quant), usability testing, service blueprints
- Interaction design, UI systems, information architecture
- Design ops: principles, process, team enablement, mentoring
- Design systems: tokens, governance, component libraries
