## 👋 Hey, I’m Andy (Kwedo)
London-based product design leader with 25+ years in digital. I work best where **strategy meets craft** — turning fuzzy opportunities into clear product direction, aligning teams, and shipping experiences that feel *inevitable*.

### What I’m known for

- esearch, rapid validation, prototyping, iteration loops  
- Design systems (tokens, governance, scalability across platforms)  
- Working tight with engineering & stakeholders to ship the real thing

## 🧠 Design mantra
**Listen carefully → understand deeply → answer with engaging, thoughtful experiences — with brand personality.**

## Focus areas
